## Development approach

- **TDD (Test-Driven Development)** for all implementation
  1. Write failing tests first (red)
  2. Write minimal code to make tests pass (green)
  3. Refactor while keeping tests green (refactor)
- Applies to both Rust (`cargo test`) and frontend (`vitest`)
- No implementation code without corresponding tests
